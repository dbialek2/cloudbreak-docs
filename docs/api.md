#API Documentation

 Cloudbreak is a RESTful application development platform whose goal is to help developers deploy HDP clusters in different environments. Once Cloudbreak is deployed in your favorite servlet container, it exposes a REST API, allowing you to spin up Hadoop clusters of any size with your chosen cloud provider.

The [API documentation](https://app.swaggerhub.com/api/Cloudbreak/Cloudbreak/1.16.1) was generated from the code using [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).
