Before getting started with Cloudbreak Deployer, you should know that:

  * The default SSH username for the GCP instances is `cloudbreak`.
  * Cloudbreak Deployer location on your VM is `/var/lib/cloudbreak-deployment`. This is the `cbd` root folder.
  * You must execute all `cbd` actions from the `cbd` root folder.


In the previous step, you should have already set up a VM with Cloudbreak Doployer either [the GCP Cloud Images](gcp.md) or by [installing the Cloudbreak Deployer](onprem.md) manually on your own VM.

There are several ways to [connect to the previously created `cbd` VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance).

## Cloudbreak Deployment Directory

To navigate to the `cloudbreak-deployment` directory, use:

```
cd /var/lib/cloudbreak-deployment
```
This directory contains configuration files and the supporting binaries for Cloudbreak Deployer.

## Initialize Your Profile

First, initialize `cbd init` by creating a `Profile` file with the following content:

```
export UAA_DEFAULT_SECRET='[SECRET]'
export UAA_DEFAULT_USER_PW='[PASSWORD]'
```
By default the `cbd` tool tries to guess `PUBLIC_IP` to bind Cloudbreak UI to it. But if `cbd` cannot get the IP address during the initialization, set the appropriate value also in your `Profile`.

## Start Cloudbreak Deployer

To start the Cloudbreak application, use the following command:
```
cbd start
```
This will start all the Docker containers and initialize the application.

>The first time you start the Coudbreak app, the process will take longer than usual due to the download of all the necessary docker images.

The `cbd start` command includes the `cbd generate` command which applies the following steps:

- creates the **docker-compose.yml** file that describes the configuration of all the Docker containers needed for the Cloudbreak deployment.
- creates the **uaa.yml** file that holds the configuration of the identity server used to authenticate users to Cloudbreak.

## Validate that Cloudbreak Deployer Has Started

After the `cbd start` command finishes, check the following:

- Pre-installed Cloudbreak Deployer version and health:
```
   cbd doctor
```
>If you need to run `cbd update`, refer to [Cloudbreak Deployer Update](update.md#update-cloudbreak-deployer). Most of the `cbd` commands require `root` permissions.

- Started Cloudbreak Application logs:
```
   cbd logs cloudbreak
```
>You should see a line like this in the log: `Started CloudbreakApplication in 36.823 seconds`. Cloudbreak normally takes less than a minute to start.
